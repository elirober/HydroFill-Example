# HydroFill-Example

There are five MATLAB .m script files included in this example repository. Only three are required to preprocess the raw DEM to produce the fully drainable DEM for illustration purposes. It should be noted that the first .m script to be executed (West_Run_I68_MSB_DEM_Creation.m) combines the corrected original raw DEM with a Microsoft Buildings raster file to produce a modified raw DEM that includes the building structures. The second .m script to be executed (West_Run_I68_MSB_Culvert_Import.m) adds the culvert (or drain) inlets and outlets via a location table CIO and the raster file nbflag. The third .m script to be executed (HydroFill_West_Run_I68.m) produces the final fully drainable DEM that includes Microsoft Building structures and 35 culverts or drains. It is mandatory that the .m scripts be executed in the proper sequence since intermediate files are generated that are required for input to the next .m script in the sequence. The remaining two .m script files provide illustration of the virtual ponding capability (HydroFill_Ponding_West_Run_I68.m) and the further processing of the fully drainable DEM to identify the drainage basin ID and the accumulative drainage area di for all grid cells (HydroDrain_West_Run_I68.m). These latter two .m scripts can be executed after the required input files have been generated.
